        Tatooine is a planet located in the Outer Rim, a region of the galaxy far removed from its core. It had three
        moons, Ghomrassen, Guermessa and Chenini. Long ago, Tatooine was covered in oceans and rainforests, but for
        unknown reasons, it became a hot desert world. Tatooine orbited twin suns, Tatoo I and Tatoo II. The
        whole planet was covered in harsh deserts, and only a small part of its northern hemisphere could sustain
        intelligent life. The landscape was covered with sand dunes, mountains, and canyons, which made traversing the
        planet very difficult. Due to the absence of surface water, those who lived on Tatooine had to draw moisture
        through the dry air.
