    <p>
      Podracing was a dangerous racing sport performed by repulsorcrafts known as podracers, which were small, one-man
      craft propelled by large engines. Popular on planets such as Malastare, Kergans, Theron, Cantonica, and Tatooine,
      individuals who competed in these games were also known as podracers.
      Racers would perform multiple laps on a particular race track, moving at dangerous and, at times, deadly speeds.
      Races could then be projected in entertainment establishments throughout the galaxy.
