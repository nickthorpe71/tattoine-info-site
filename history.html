    <h2>Tatooine's History</h2>

      We know Tatooine as an inhospitable desert world, but that has not always been the case. The canon reference
      book Ultimate Star Wars confirms that Tatooine once had forests and oceans, but that some unknown event
      permanently changed the climate of the planet. In the current, Disney-maintained history of the Star Wars
      universe, there's no official explanation of how Tatooine became the dry rock we know today, which means this
      piece of part of the story is still the stuff of Legends.

      As revealed in the codex of the video game Knights of the Old Republic and the comics series Dawn of the Jedi:
      Force Storm (both of which are now apocryphal), an ancient race called the Kumumgah lived on the lush and vibrant
      Tatooine 25 millennia before the rise of the Galactic Empire. The Kumumgah developed interstellar travel and
      started colonizing nearby space, which attracted the attention of the massive, advanced Infinite Empire. When the
      Kumumgah resisted being colonized and enslaved by the Infinite Empire, the Empire made an example of them by
      bombarding Tatooine until it turned to glass, which broke into sand over centuries. In the ensuing age between the
      siege of Tatooine and the time of The Phantom Menace, the Kumumgah are believed to have adapted to their new
      desert environment by evolving into two different species — the Jawas and the Tusken Raiders.
